Describe the position of each object using relative terms that reflect their visual arrangement within the image.
For objects that are clustered, first describe their positions within the cluster using terms such as 'upper right corner', 'left of', 'middle of' and proximity indicators like ‘closest to’ and ‘farthest from’ to specify exact relationships.  
For objects that are in a linear arrangement, use descriptors such as 'farthest to the left',  and 'second from the right' based on their relative position to each other.
When describing an isolated object or a cluster, reference its position in relation to image, not to objects.
You will be given a list of entities, each representing an object in the image:
<objects>
These entities include a class name and center point coordinates in the format (x_center, y_center). 
Your goal is to provide a clear and distinct description for each object, determining whether they are clustered or isolated, and following the examples provided. Each description must be a concise phrase and MUST use the class name as the subject. Descriptions MUST only relate an object of the same class or to the image, not to objects of different classes.
